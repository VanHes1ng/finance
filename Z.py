            This system is designed to provide valuable insights into future market movements,
            enabling users to make informed decisions regarding their investments without directly executing trades. 
            It leverages the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) as a key indicator for predicting trends, 
            in the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) market.

            When the VIX indicates decreasing volatility, suggesting a more stable market environment, 
            the system implies that SPY may experience an upward trend. 
            This information aids users in considering investment strategies that align with potential market improvements.
            Conversely, when the VIX suggests increasing volatility, indicating potential market turbulence, 
            the system helps users consider strategies that account for potential market downturns.""")

                 with the price of each option representing the market's expectation of 30-day forward-looking volatility.
